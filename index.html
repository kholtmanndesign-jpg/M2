        <div>
          <p>
            Martin Luther King Jr. (1929–1968) was a Baptist minister and one of the most
            influential leaders of the American civil rights movement. He advocated for
            equality through nonviolent protest and civil disobedience, challenging systems
            of segregation and discrimination in the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born in Atlanta, Georgia, King studied theology and became a pastor before
            emerging as a national figure during the Montgomery bus boycott in the mid‑1950s.
            His leadership connected religious conviction with a call for social justice and
            human rights.

      <h2>“I Have a Dream”</h2>
      <p>
        On August 28, 1963, during the March on Washington, King delivered his
        “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial. In this address, he spoke about
        his vision of a United States where people would be judged by their character
        rather than the color of their skin.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning
        of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self‑evident, that all men are created equal.’”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The speech became one of the most famous in American history and continues to inspire
        movements for equality, justice, and human rights around the world.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Martin Luther King Jr.’s work helped lead to major civil rights laws, including
        legislation that outlawed segregation and protected voting rights. His approach to
        nonviolence influenced activists across the globe, from anti‑apartheid movements to
        modern campaigns for social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, a federal holiday honors his life and work each January.
        Schools, communities, and organizations often mark the day with service projects and
        discussions focused on equality, justice, and community building.
